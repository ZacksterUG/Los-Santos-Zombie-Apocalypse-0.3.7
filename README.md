## About gamemode ##
The zombie server that was originally created by cyber_punk

The main idea of gamemode is the confrontation of two teams - Zombies and Humans
Zombies' goal is to infect all of humans on the map
Humans' goal is to survive and clear 8 checkpoints

Both teams have their own special features. Both teams have perks that are unlocked on each rank.
Perks let players gain a little advantage before opponent. 
Humans have inventory. On spawn they get standart kit of items:
- 3 large med kits
- 4 medium med kits
- 5 small med kits
- 3 flashlights
- 3 can of fuel and oil for filling up vehicle

There are 2 types of items in the game - permament and temporary
Permament items are items that can be crafted except weapons, they are given for 1 round.
Temporary items are availaible for use during round if they are not used they dissapear in the next round.

Also both teams gain special points: DNA points for zombies and materials for humans
Materials are used in crafting for humans. You can craft items in special places with crafting table (marked with a blue skull on map)
or can be crafted on the item crafting table in inventory (you can craft it in special place also) 

Players can gain xp by killing zombie NPC, players from opponent team or completing achievements.
When players gain enough XP they get a higher rank. Every 5 ranks humans gain new powerful weapons.
On each rank their ammo increases. Zombies increases their max available health every 5 rank too. Max health is obtained on 30 rank
and amount of health is 250.

During the players can participate in some events. Humans can loot in special place in order to gain special bullets or materails.
Also they can loot for regular items in interiors.

After the 5th checkpoint there is a chance of appearing of looting box. The aim of zombies is destroying it, humans - capture it.
Zombies just receive XP. Humans get some regular items that help them to survive.

Also there is one of the most fascinating events. It is appearance of the Alpha Zombies. These zombies are very powerful and dangerous.
They damage like regular players and can change their perks and behaviour that depends on various circumstances. 
Their assassination award a lot of XP, items, materials. Everyone who participated receives alpha essence.
